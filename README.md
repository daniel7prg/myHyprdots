<h1 align="center">Hyprland Dotfiles</h1>

Hello whoever came here to my Hyprland settings, I want you to know that this setting 
is intended for my personal use, so some things may not work on your computer so you will 
have to change it manually. I'm currently working on a script that allows me to 
place my settings automatically. Sorry for my english, I'm still learning.

> **NOTE:** This configuration was done in Arch Linux (Install first) !!
