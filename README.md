<h1 align="center">Hyprland Dotfiles</h1>

Hello whoever came here to my Hyprland settings, I want you to know that this setting 
is intended for my personal use, so some things may not work on your computer so you will 
have to change it manually. I'm currently working on a script that allows me to 
place my settings automatically. Sorry for my english, I'm still learning.

> [!CAUTION]
> This installation script is created for a minimal Arch Linux installation, though it might work on some Arch-based distributions. However, installing it alongside another desktop environment or window manager is risky. Because the setup is heavily customized, conflicts with your GTK/Qt theme, shell, SDDM, GRUB, etc., are possible. Installation alongside other environments is at YOUR OWN RISK.
